				<p>
					Strygwyr, the Bloodseeker, is a melee agility hero imbued with dreadful powers to fuel violence and rip enemies apart in the heat of close combat.
					He can drive targets into a maddened Bloodrage, increasing the damage of their attacks, and allowing them to heal their wounds by killing their enemies. He can also cast Bloodrage on himself turning him into a nuker. His speed is unmatched when he senses the blood of the dying, and from this perception none can escape his Thirst. By using Blood Rite, he can create a ritual field where his foes will be silenced and damaged in the process. His trademark ultimate, Rupture, sunders the skin of his victims, causing them to trail their life force behind if they dare to flee. The ability is so persistent just like Bloodseeker himself, totally ignores magic resistance and immunes to any kind of Dispel. Almost nothing can save the victim from the wicked wound and the wicked hunter coming for them, except the death itself.
